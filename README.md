# InvenTrack — E-Commerce Inventory & Order Management System

A second full-stack CRUD project (companion to the Student Management System) built with **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Core Java, and MongoDB**. It reuses the same architecture and patterns you already know, while adding: multi-collection relationships, stock/business logic, and a `$lookup`-based aggregation report.

> **Note on sample orders:** Unlike products, don't bulk-import `sampleOrders_reference_only.json` directly into MongoDB — it's provided only as a reference for the document structure. Orders must be placed **through the app's UI** (`orders.html`) so that the Java backend correctly deducts product stock and generates order IDs. This mirrors how a real e-commerce system works.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Same as the first project — if you already set these up, skip to Step 1:
1. **JDK 17+** — https://adoptium.net
2. **VS Code** with "Extension Pack for Java" and "Live Server" extensions
3. **MongoDB Community Server** (running as a Windows Service)
4. **MongoDB Compass**

---

## 🗄️ Step 1 — Set Up the Database

1. Open **MongoDB Compass**, connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
2. Create a new database named **`EcommerceInventoryDB`** with a collection named **`products`**.
3. Inside `EcommerceInventoryDB`, create a second collection named **`orders`** (Compass: right-click the database → "Create Collection").
4. Import sample data into `products`:
   - Click the `products` collection → **Add Data → Import File** → select `database/sampleProducts.json` → file type **JSON** → **Import**.
5. Leave `orders` empty for now — you'll create orders through the app itself.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2 — Set Up the Backend

### 2.1 Reuse or Download the Required Libraries

If you still have the `.jar` files from the Student Management System project (`mongodb-driver-sync`, `mongodb-driver-core`, `bson`, `json-20240303.jar`), just **copy them** into this project's `backend/lib/` folder — they work identically here.

Otherwise, download them fresh (see Project 1's README for direct links to https://mvnrepository.com) and place them in `backend/lib/`.

### 2.2 Compile the Backend

```bash
cd backend
javac -cp "lib/*" -d out src/*.java
```

### 2.3 Run the Backend Server

```bash
java -cp "out;lib/*" Main
```

You should see:
```
=================================================
 InvenTrack - E-Commerce Inventory Backend Server
 Running at: http://localhost:8080
 Products API: http://localhost:8080/api/products
 Orders API:   http://localhost:8080/api/orders
 Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.
=================================================
```

**Keep this terminal open.**

### 2.4 Quick Test

Visit `http://localhost:8080/api/products` in your browser — you should see your 10 imported products as JSON.

---

## 🌐 Step 3 — Run the Frontend

1. In VS Code, right-click `frontend/index.html` → **"Open with Live Server"**.
2. From the Home page, go to **Products** to review/manage inventory, or **Orders** to place a test order.
3. Try placing an order on `orders.html`: pick 1–2 products, set quantities, submit. Watch the product's stock quantity drop when you check `products.html` afterward — and watch the **Sales by Category** and **Top Selling Products** reports populate on the Orders page.
4. Try changing an order's status to **Cancelled** and confirm the stock is restored.

## 🔌 API Reference

### Products
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/products` | Get all products |
| GET | `/api/products/{id}` | Get one product |
| GET | `/api/products/search?query=&category=&stockStatus=` | Search/filter (`stockStatus`: `low` or `out`) |
| GET | `/api/products/stats` | Aggregation: total products, stock value, low-stock count, category count |
| POST | `/api/products` | Create a product |
| PUT | `/api/products/{id}` | Update a product |
| DELETE | `/api/products/{id}` | Delete a product |

### Orders
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/orders` | Get all orders (newest first) |
| GET | `/api/orders/{id}` | Get one order |
| GET | `/api/orders/search?query=&status=` | Search/filter orders |
| GET | `/api/orders/stats` | Aggregation: total orders, revenue, pending count, avg order value |
| GET | `/api/orders/reports/sales-by-category` | **$lookup** report: revenue/units sold per product category |
| GET | `/api/orders/reports/top-products?limit=5` | Top-selling products by revenue |
| POST | `/api/orders` | Place a new order (deducts stock automatically) |
| PUT | `/api/orders/{id}/status` | Update order status (cancelling restores stock) |
| DELETE | `/api/orders/{id}` | Delete an order |

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Same tips as Project 1's README apply — check `services.msc` for MongoDB, ensure the backend terminal is running, and use Live Server (not double-clicking HTML files) to avoid CORS issues.

**New for this project:** if placing an order fails with "Insufficient stock" or "Product not found", that's the `OrderException` business-logic check working correctly — try a product with available stock (check `products.html` for current quantities).
